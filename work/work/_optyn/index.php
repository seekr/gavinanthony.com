		<div class="divider"></div>
		<p>During my 2013 summer internship at the startup-accelerator company, gener8tor, I worked with Optyn on several different projects. The first projects I was assigned to was redesigning their homepage, focusing heavily on the consumer side of the site rather than the merchant side. The result was a single-page web design that showcased the company's main features for the consumers, while also giving merchants information on pricing and a place to sign up.</p>

			<h1>The Company</h1>
			<p>Optyn makes marketing simple for small businesses by providing easy, automated tools to acquire and engage their customers. Optynâ€™s marketing platform helps business owners decide what message to communicate and then enables them to create, schedule and send an email campaign in less than 2 minutes. Optyn also ensures consumers only get emails from merchants they have chosen. While I was at Optyn, I created a redesign of their homepage and designed/developed a merchant-mobile web application.</p>

				<h1>Homepage Redesign</h1>
				<p class="width-50">One of my main assignments during my work Optyn was to redesign their homepage. Their current page had been more aimed towards the consumer side, so my design was to capture the business side.</p>
