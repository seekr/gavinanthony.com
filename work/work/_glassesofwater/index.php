		<h2>March 2013</h2>

		<p>I created Glasses of Water to help all of the people that like staying hydrated. It counts the amount of glasses of water you drink and shares it in a social network setting. After a year of being in service, it came to have over 6,500 users in over 100 countries!</p>

			<h1>The Idea</h1>
			<p>A hot day in August, I had been drinking a lot of water. I'd been drinking a lot of water every day for the last month actually. That's when I thought: "Why are there no social networks out there that you can share this information with?". So I made one. It took about 1 month to make, and got over 2,000 users on the first version. Then two years later, I decided to give it a refresh. To completely redesign it. So After another month of work, I wrote it completely from the ground up. After another year, the network has come to have over 7,000 users total to this day.</p>
