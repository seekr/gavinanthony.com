			<h1>Philosophy</h1>
			<p>To me, communication design is about solving problems. As a designer, I strive to define problems everywhere I look. Defining the problem is the first step in creating an effective design that clearly communicates the purpose of a product.<br><br>

		    Almost every design I see inspires me in some way to look at something differently, or to question what I’ve already made and ask myself if I can make it better. My biggest inspiration would be Steve Jobs, who said “Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works”. This quote perfectly states how I like to design. Steve Jobs’ perseverance, creativity, and innovation have inspired me to try different approaches to design, while still trying to improve how something works exceptionally well.<br><br>

		   I’ve never changed my style to any particular design movements in my field, such as designs going flat or skeuomorphic. I consider myself a minimalist and I design with simplicity in mind. Leonardo da Vinci once said “Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication” and I could not agree more. With designs changing all the time, I strive for simplicity in hopes my designs are timeless.</p>

		<h1>CAREER</h1>
		<p>I first started teaching myself web design and development in 2011. From 2011 to 2012, I launched a personal project called Glasses of Water. After about a year of being on the Google Chrome web store, it gained over 16,000 users from over 100 different countries.<br><br>

Working with many startup companies in the gener8tor program, I was able to do what I love most: define problems, and solve them through design. There were no shortage of problems either, as I worked with four companies, from redesigning entire websites to creating mobile websites from scratch.<br><br>

Besides working with gener8tor, I have also had many clients through freelance work. Many of which, being iOS applications that are on the app store or being developed.<br><br>

In 2014, I was hired by Taplet to become the sole product designer on their team. I worked directly with the founder to design the app from the ground up and with a development team to implement designs. Taplet launched April 7th, after a year of development and has raised $1 million in seed funding. Within 1 week, Taplet got over 10,000+ downloads and 70+ five star reviews.<br><br>

I am currently working with the Taplet team and various other freelance clients. If you are interesting in working with me on a contract basis or hiring me full time, please <a href="/contact">contact</a> me.</p>
